    <h1>Elote Pizza </h1>
    <img src="Pizza.jpg">
    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>This grilled elote pizza brings the flavors you love in Mexican street corn to a pizza–corn, 
        chili-lime seasoning, jalapenos, cheese, and crema–and it's made even better by creating it on the grill.</p>
     <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons sour cream, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili lime seasoning, such as Tajin® Clasico, divided

        </li>
        <li>1/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded quesadilla cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>1/4 red onion, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno, very thinly sliced, or more to taste

        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons melted butter</li>
     </ul>

     <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
     <ol>
      
        <li>Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes. Shape pizza dough and brush with olive oil.

        </li>
    
        <li>Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.</li>
   
        <li>Carefully place dough (olive oil side facing down) onto the grill over direct heat Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.

        </li>
        
       
        <li>Use tongs to move dough to the indirect heat; do not flip dough over! Cook 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove dough to a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Stir together 2 tablespoons sour cream, mayonnaise, and 1 1/2 teaspoons Tajin seasoning. Spread sour cream mixture over dough. Mix remaining Tajin, cotija, quesadilla cheese, corn, and red onions. Distribute topping mixture over dough.</li>
        <li>Return pizza to grill. Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pizza from the grill. Scatter cilantro and jalapeños over pizza, and drizzle with additional sour cream. Mix melted butter with remaining 1/2 teaspoon Tajin seasoning and brush crust with Tajin butter. Cut into wedges and serve.

     </ol>
